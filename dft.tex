Molecular electronic Hamiltonian
\begin{equation*}
H = T + V_{ee} + V_{en}
\end{equation*}
\pause
Make the approximation that the electrons interact with the \emph{mean field} of the other electrons\\
\pause
\begin{equation*}
H = T + V_{ee} + V_{en}
\end{equation*}
\pause
\begin{align*}
F &= H^{\mathrm{core}} + G \\
G_{\lambda\sigma} &= \sum_{\lambda\sigma} P_{\lambda\sigma}[2(\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma) - (\mu\lambda|\nu\sigma)]
\end{align*}

HF neglects \emph{electron correlation}\\ \vfill
\pause
Electron correlation can be static (multiple near equal energy configurations) and dynamics electron/electron reactions. \\ \vfill
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{corr}} = E_{\mathrm{HF}} - E_{\mathrm{TRUE}}
\end{equation}
\pause
\vfill
This happens because in reality the electrons don't interact with the mean field of the electrons; they interact with all the other electrons.
